## Problem Statement

Modern web users frequently keep numerous, cluttered tabs open for extended periods, planning to revisit them later. Yet, managing these tabs and recalling to review or close them can be overwhelming. Such tabs not only consume memory but also reduce work efficiency. Currently, there's a shortage of effective tools designed for tab organization and for prompting users to address long-neglected, unused tabs.

## Target Audience

The target audience for TabNest includes:

- Professionals who research or work with multiple web resources simultaneously
- Students who open multiple tabs for study materials and research papers
- Anyone who tends to keep tabs open for extended periods, planning to revisit them later
