## Problem Statement

Often times, when doing research, we come across published data visualizations (e.g. a bar chart or a line graph). This could be on a web-page or a PDF, or even a research paper. However, what can be very valuable to users is the underlying numbers behind the visual, and this can be very difficult to obtain (accurately) simply from viewing the visual.

## Target Audience

Anyone who performs data analysis or research, or must present analysis, data or research. 

## Description

When coming across charts, graphs or other forms of data visualizations on web-pages or PDF documents within Chrome, the Chrome extension can be toggled for the user to select (like how one takes a screenshot) the visual. The extension will then interpret the data behind the visualization and insert the formatted data into a Google Sheet.

## Selling Points

1. Enables the user not to have to spend time finding underlying data of visuals, which may not even be published.
2. Enables the user to reformat the visuals of others in a way that is their preferred formatting rather than inserting visuals that may look out of place.
3. Enables the user to present data in a way of their choosing (e.g., converting a bar chart into a line chart).
4. Enables the user to perform analysis on and use data in ways that are not efficient from a visualization.
5. Enables the user to quickly have formatted data tables in Google Sheets of their choosing from quick screenshot-like interactions.

## User Stories

As an investment analyst, I want to easily obtain data from the published graphs of others so that I can reformat them in the preferred way of my company.
As a data scientist, I want to easily obtain underlying data of published graphs so that I can perform data analysis techniques.

## Notes

This would likely work by counting the number of pixels of the data bar and comparing it to the number of pixels of the axes to understand what the value is for a given data point.

## References & Inspiration

I came up with this idea during my summer internship where I really wished I had a tool like this. I spent a lot of time guessing data values or counting lines.
