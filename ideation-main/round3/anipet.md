## Problem Statement

Organizing and keeping track of various events can be challenging, especially when information about them is scattered across different web pages. Users often have to manually enter event details into their calendars, a process that can be both time-consuming and error-prone. This Chrome Extension aims to streamline this process, making it easier for users to add events to their calendars directly from web content, thereby enhancing productivity and reducing the chances of missing important events.

## Target Audience

The target audience for Event Scheduler includes:

- Busy professionals who need to manage their schedules efficiently.
- Students who attend multiple events, lectures, and deadlines.
- Anyone who frequently adds events from websites to their personal calendars.
- Organizers who need to keep track of various meetings and events.

## Description

QuickAdd is a Chrome Extension that simplifies the process of adding events to Google Calendar. By simply highlighting text on a webpage that contains the place, date, and time of an event, users can add the event to their calendar with just one click.

## Notes

While the extension is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, it will require permissions to access the user's Google Calendar to add events. Future versions could include features like language detection for non-English websites, integration with other calendar services, and the ability to suggest event categories based on the content of the highlighted text.
