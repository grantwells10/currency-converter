## Authors

Chelsea Pan, Gabby Gu

## Problem Statement

Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become more popular to move classes and meetings online. 
Naturally, this means many presentations are presented virtually. 
Many people find it hard to teach and present in an engaging way while also operating within given time constraints. 

## Target Audience

People presenting (can be online or in person) that struggle with public speaking or want a smoother presentation process. 

## Description

The Presentie extension will help users practice their presentations, display notes for each slide, 
give time warnings, and provide talking point examples for users. 

## Selling Points

1. Presentie helps users practice their presentations.
2. Presentie will display a timer and give users gentle reminders when to move on given the time constraint.
3. Presentie will display notes for each slide.
4. Presentie will provide talking point examples for users based on the content of the slide.
5. Presentie will help soothe the user's public speaking anxieties.

1. As an anxious public speaker, I want to present with my notes clearly displayed so I don't forget what to say.
2. As a stressed presenter, I want to present without going over the time limit so I don't get cut off.
3. As a teacher, I want reminders to ask students questions so they feel engaged.
4. As an anxious presenter, I want examples of what to say for each slide when practicing to get inspiration.
5. As a presenter, I want the ability to customize time constraints for each slide so that I know when I'm going too fast or too slow.
6. As a presenter, I want the ability to click on my notes to advance my notes and my slides to the next slide to make my transitions smoother.
7. As a presenter, I want to share my screen to show my presentation without revealing my notes so I seem more prepared.
8. As a student, I want to easily present with all my notes without needing a second monitor so I can present smoother.
9. As a teacher, I want the ability to add time to my clock while I'm teaching so I can be more flexible.
10. As a novice presenter, I want subtle reminders while presenting to engage my audience so that I can be a better presenter.
11. As a collaborator, I want the functionality to be able to collaborate with someone on my presentation notes so we are both on the same page.
12. As a presenter, I would like my edits to be automatically saved to Google Drive/the cloud to keep my progress.
13. As a nervous presenter, I would like milestonees and encouragement while I practice to boost my confidence.
14. As a user with visual imparities, I would like a high contrast version/dark mode version so that I can use the app eaesily.
15. As a presenter, I would like small indications and reminders to be kept to a minimum so I don't lose my train of thought while presenting.

## Notes

Since this chrome extension will presumably create a pop up window, we need to make sure this functionality is allowed. Also, we want the
pop up to kind of mirror the actual chrome tab so when you click somewhere on the pop up, it'll "click" on the tab and advance to the next slide.
