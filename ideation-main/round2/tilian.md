Many application websites have prompts that require users to meet a certain word minimum or stay under a maximum. This can be particularly challenging when the textbox does not have a built-in word count system. There are roundabout solutions such as copying and pasting the text into a text editor such as google docs which is time consuming and incovenient, especially on a deadline.
