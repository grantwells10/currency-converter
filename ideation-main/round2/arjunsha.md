## Authors

Arjun Shah, Max Mercado

## Problem Statement

Students are faced with a large amount of information when studying from numerous different sources (i.e. Youtube videos, powerpoint slides, books, and personal notes). This multimodal bot allows users to extract meaningful information from a variety of sources, compiles them, and then outputs them in an organized and readable fashion.

## Target Audience

The target audience includes:

- Students
- Professionals that deal with numerous streams of entertainment
- Researchers that need to review a lot of information at once


## Description
As a multimodal bot, Multimodal Study Bot uses ChatGPT or other LLM's to summarize large pieces of information from different sources. The internal LLM is able to extract meaningful data from sources such as YouTube videos, powerpoint slides, personal notes etc. and then combines/compiles the files together. It then outputs a well-organized combination of the following input data sources and provides greater insight into descrepencies between each of the sources. 

## Selling Points

1. Speeds up studying time by allowing students to analyze different data sources and combine outputs quickly.
2. Outputs differences between sources to help the user discern what's true or false.
3. Outputs data in a well-organized fashion for professional/public use.
4. Allows users to interact with combined data source and recommends other possible data sources from the internet that may be of help.
5. Easy to use interface which does not require any coding or technical knowledge.
