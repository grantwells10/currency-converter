simply click on the extension and that will autofill 
with a newly created email and password.

2. Quick access to sites (no need to manually create email)
3. Avoid spam emails/unwanted email lists
4. News articles without having to sign up
5. Academic tool to help access study sites behind email sign in
6. save email logins on each site while the email is still active
7. show lists of sites you have access to

## User Stories

As a user interested in accessing multiple free trials without using my primary email, 
I want to generate and use a unique temporary email for each trial, so that I can enjoy 
the benefits without the risk of spam or compromising my personal information.

As a student who needs access to premium study materials blocked behind email signups, 
I want to use temporary emails to register on educational websites, so that I can obtain 
the resources without cluttering my school email with marketing messages.

As a privacy-conscious individual wary of sharing personal details online, 
I want to use temporary emails when signing up for newsletters or accounts, 
so that I can protect my identity and keep my primary email address private.

As a professional researching competitive products and services, 
I want to sign up for competitor newsletters and access gated content without 
revealing my work email, so that I can gather information discreetly using temporary emails.

As an enthusiast who loves entering online contests and giveaways, 
I want to increase my chances of winning by signing up multiple times with 
different emails, so that I can do so without receiving a barrage of promotional
emails in my main inbox.

As a cautious online shopper, I want the extension to save the login credentials for each 
temporary email account while the email is still active, so that I can access order confirmations and 
shipping updates without remembering each unique email address.

As a privacy-conscious user, I want to see a list of all the sites I have accessed using temporary emails through the extension, 
so that I can easily keep track of where my information might be and reassess my subscriptions or accounts as needed.

As a freelancer testing multiple client websites, I want the extension to allow me to generate and manage different email profiles for various projects, 
so that I can easily segregate my work and ensure that communications do not overlap or cause confusion.

As a user interested in maintaining online anonymity, I want the extension to automatically delete emails and 
login credentials once the temporary email expires or I choose to terminate it, ensuring that my temporary online 
presence leaves no trace.

As a user who often forgets to cancel trial subscriptions, I want the extension to remind me before a temporary 
email expires, giving me the chance to either extend the email's validity, cancel the subscription, or transfer 
my account details to a permanent email address.

## Notes

Potential challenges: 
- Dealing with the clean up of many random generated emails (when to delete, etc.)
- Legality of multiple free trials


## References & Inspiration

I used to want to look at different quizlets for studying but always have a new email for the free trial of quizlet plus. 
The site below would help me circumvent that, but I believe it would be easier in a chrome extension
