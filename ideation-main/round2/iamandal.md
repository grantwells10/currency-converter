## Authors

Amanda Lee, Sydney Simon

## Problem Statement

Trip planning can take a lot of work to do, especially when you are on a budget and need to consider how much each activity costs. This is even more difficult when planning for international trips, and you don't know how much it costs to book hotels and activities. With the exchange of currency and their fluctuating values, it can be hard to keep track of how much you are spending.

## Target Audience

The target audience for BudgeTrip includes:

- Users with planning trips on a budget
- Users keeping track of costs for international trips
- Users that want to compare costs of activities, places to stay, etc when planning
- Users that often travel between different countries and want to stay on top of their spending habits
- Users that want to collaborate on making a trip itinerary

## Description

BudgeTrip is a Chrome Extension that help users to plan for international trips by allowing them to add events to a database that they can use to plan their trips (via dropdown). Each event includes the title of the event (i.e. an activity, place to stay, place to eat, etc.), the date and time of the event, a picture of choice, a description, and a cost estimate in either their home or destination currency. Each event can display this information (such that the event is editable) as well as the cost estimate in the other currency.

## Selling Points

1. Helps with budgeting for international trips
2. Helps organize trip plans with a strong feature of keeping updated information on how much money will be expected to be spent
