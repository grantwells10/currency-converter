## Problem Statement
This Chrome Extension aims to allow the job application process to be less time consuming. Users often need to answer the same tedious questions over and over again to apply for jobs. In addition, with large application volume, users may struggle to keep track of the jobs they have already applied for. Applicants also may worry about the strength of their application and want feedback on how to improve.

## Target Audience
The target audience of FastApply are any users who are currently looking for jobs/internships.

## Description
FastApply is a Chrome Extension that allows the user to submit their personalized information (i.e résumé, work experience, ethnicity, etc.) and then autofills job applications with that information. If FastApply makes any mistakes, the user should easily be able to adjust FastApply to prevent the same mistakes from happening again. In addition, FastApply will maintain information about jobs that the user has already applied for so that they will not waste additional time.

## Selling Points

1. Simple and intuitive interface for the user to use
2. Automatically detect whether or not a specific job has already been applied to
3. Fills out applications quickly
4. Information can be maintained across devices
5. Allows users to spend more time on other aspects of their search

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to easily update my information, so that companies will see the most up-to-date information about myself.
2. As a user, I want to the extension to securely store my data, so that my data will only be seen by those who need it for my application.
3. As a user, I want to notify the extension of any questions that it has missed, so that in future applications, those questions will be answered.
4. As a user, I want to be able to check if a job application has already been applied for, so that I don't waste time reapplying to a job.
5. As a user, I want to be able to check if a job matches specific requirements I have set in place, so that I can quickly decide if I want to apply.
6. As a user, I want to be able to generate a cover letter for the specific company based on my information, so that I can increase my chances of getting hired.
7. As a user, I want to get automated feedback on my résumé, so that I can increase my chances of getting hired.
8. As a user, I want to extract the core details of the job description such as location, pay, qualifications, etc, so that I can quickly assess whether this job is for me.
9. As a user, I want to be able to keep my information across devices, so that I can apply to jobs on whichever device I have available to me.
10. As a user, I want to be able to receive links/resources about company and required skills for a specific job, so that I can better prepare for the position.

## Notes
Potential challenges include security, parsing the application and answering each question with the specified information, and efficiently storing information about jobs that have just been applied for. Creating automated feedback on résumé and writing personalized letters may involve API calls to ChatGPT or developing some AI logic. Additional scraping needs to be done on the job description to extract key information about the job.
## References & Inspiration

I was inspired by the Simplify jobs Chrome Extension. It does a similar job, but sometimes it does not take into account specific parts of some job applications such as languages spoken, etc.
