## Problem Statement

Language learners often struggle to find engaging and authentic content in their target language that matches their skill level. Traditional language learning resources can be repetitive and lack the context and relevance of real-world content. This extension aims to solve this problem by automatically translating portions of web pages into the user's target language, creating an immersive language learning experience while browsing content that aligns with their interests.

## Target Audience

The target audience for Language Immersion Creator includes:

- Language learners of all levels who want to practice their skills with authentic content
- Students looking to supplement their language courses with immersive reading practice
- Professionals seeking to improve their language proficiency for work or travel
- Anyone interested in learning a new language through contextual immersion

## Description

Language Immersion Creator is a Chrome Extension that automatically translates portions of web pages into the user's target language, creating an immersive language learning experience. Users can customize the extent of translation based on their skill level, allowing them to gradually increase the immersion as they progress.

## Selling Points

1. Authentic immersive language learning experience while browsing content of interest
2. Customizable translation settings based on user's skill level
3. Seamless integration with everyday browsing habits
4. Supports a wide range of languages for learners at all stages
5. Open-source and free to use, with no hidden costs or subscriptions

## User Stories

1. As a beginner Spanish learner, I want to read articles about my favorite hobbies with some words and phrases translated into Spanish, so that I can learn new vocabulary in a relevant context.
2. As an intermediate French learner, I want to gradually increase the proportion of French in the articles I read, so that I can challenge myself and improve my comprehension skills over time.
3. As an advanced German learner, I want to read news articles with only a few key words translated into German, so that I can maintain my proficiency and stay up-to-date with current events.
4. As a language teacher, I want to recommend this extension to my students as a way to practice their skills outside of the classroom, so that they can engage with authentic content and develop their language intuition.
5. As a busy professional learning Japanese for work, I want to integrate language learning into my daily browsing routine, so that I can make progress without dedicating extra time to study.
6. As a language learner, I want to have control over the types of words and phrases that are translated, so that I can focus on areas where I need the most practice.

## Notes

The extension will need to efficiently translate selected words and phrases without slowing down page load times. Leveraging client-side translation libraries and caching mechanisms will be crucial for performance. The algorithm for selecting which words and phrases to translate based on the user's skill level will require careful design and testing to ensure an effective and engaging learning experience.

## Technical Details

### User Interface

The extension will have a simple and unobtrusive interface that allows users to customize their language learning experience. Key UI elements include:

1. Language selector: Users can choose their target language from a dropdown menu.
2. Immersion level slider: Users can adjust the percentage of the page that will be translated into the target language.
3. Translation toggle: Users can easily turn the extension on or off for each web page.
4. Settings menu: Users can configure advanced options such as the types of words and phrases to translate (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives).

We will use the following Chrome UI/UX elements:

- Browser action: To allow users to access the extension's settings and toggle translation on or off
- Content scripts: To modify the web page content and apply the translations
- Storage: To store user preferences and settings

### API, Libraries, and Frameworks

- Chrome Extension API: For building the core extension functionality (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/)
- Simple-Translator: A client-side translation library that supports multiple languages (https://github.com/andreasremdt/simple-translator)
- React: For the slide interface (https://react.dev/)
- jQuery: For simplified DOM manipulation and event handling (https://jquery.com/)

### Data Storage

We will use Chrome's sync storage to store the following data:

User Preferences:

- Target language
- Immersion level percentage
- Translation toggle state
- Advanced settings (e.g., types of words and phrases to translate)
- Possibly a list of words and phrases translated for the user's reference
