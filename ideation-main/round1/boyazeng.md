## User Stories

1. I enjoy watching bilingual videos or foreign reality shows for entertainment, but captions for them are not always available on online video sites.
2. As a user who frequently watches short videos for entertainment with headphones on, I always find it annoying when a loud video suddenly pop up. I want my browser to dynamically control the sounds volume for me.
3. As a user who has trouble hearing and often need to manually turn up volumes for certain videos, I want to be able to set a high volume as a default for my browser's sound output.
