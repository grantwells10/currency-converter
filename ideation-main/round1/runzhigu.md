## Problem Statement

Students, researchers, and information-seekers often struggle with the overwhelming task of sifting through vast amounts of online content to find relevant information. The process of reading, summarizing, and recording pertinent details for future reference is time-consuming and inefficient. Furthermore, there is a lack of effective tools to easily aggregate, summarize, and navigate through the sea of information available online, making the research process daunting and less productive.


## Target Audience

The AI Research Assistant extension targets:

Students conducting research for academic papers or projects.
Researchers gathering information across various fields.
Anyone who frequently engages in extensive online reading and needs to compile and reference information efficiently.

## Description

The AI Research Assistant is a Chrome Extension powered by ChatGPT, designed to enhance the online research process. It offers a sidebar interface that allows users to summarize web pages or specific sections, navigate and highlight relevant information on a topic, and bookmark pages with summaries and highlighted quotes for easy reference. This tool transforms the cumbersome task of online research into a streamlined and productive experience.

## Selling Points

1. Enhances research productivity by simplifying the process of aggregating and referencing key information with smooth user experience
2. Integrates seamlessly with Google Chrome as a sidebar, providing easy access without disrupting the browsing experience.
3. Efficiently summarizes entire webpages or selected text to save time.
4. Uses advanced AI to highlight and navigate to information relevant to users' research topics.    
5. Offers bookmarking functionality with summaries and highlighted quotes for quick future reference.

## User Stories

As a student, I want to quickly summarize long academic papers or articles so that I can understand their essence without spending hours reading.
As a researcher, I need to highlight and record down all relevant information about a specific topic on a webpage so that I can focus on what's important for my study.
As a frequent reader, I want to bookmark webpages with their summaries and highlighted sections so that I can easily return to them for future reference.
As an academic writer, I need to aggregate information from multiple sources efficiently so that I can cite them accurately in my work.
As a curious learner, I want to ask specific questions and get relevant information highlighted on any webpage so that I can learn more about topics of interest without unnecessary clutter.

## Notes

A potential challenge is ensuring the AI understands the context and relevance of information accurately across different fields of study.
Considering privacy concerns, it's important to clarify how data (e.g., bookmarks and highlights) is stored and managed.
The extension could offer customization options for summary length and highlight themes to accommodate user preferences.
Future iterations could include features like automatic citation generation and integration with academic databases for more comprehensive research support.
