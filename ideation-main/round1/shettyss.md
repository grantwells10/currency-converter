## Problem Statement

When designing web applications, a common challenge for developers is creating an aesthetic and cohesive color palette to guide their styling choices. Selecting complementary colors can be time-consuming and requires a good eye for design, which is why a tool that can automate the process could be helpful. This extension will allow users to pick a base color (using some sort of color dropper tool), and then the extension will generate a corresponding color palette.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this extension includes:

- Frontend web developers who need to style web pages
- UI designers who need to design web pages
- Artists who need to create color palettes for graphic design
- Content creators/marketing teams who need to generate color schemes for digital content

## Description

Color Palette Generator is a chrome extension that generates a beautiful, cohesive color palette for users based on an inputted base color. Users can easily use a dropper tool to select their initial color, and Color Palette Generator will provide them with a corresponding color palette that will suit their design needs.

## Selling Points

1. Easy to use with a very simple interface
2. Can save favorite color palettes across browsing sessions
3. Optimizes the work of a web designer by simplifying the color selection process
4. Can regenerate color palette as many times until the user is satisfied
5. Allows user to select a base color as a foundation for the palette

## User Stories

1. As a web developer with little artistic skill, I want to be able to create aesthetic pages for my clients.
2. As a busy UI designer, I want a simple, easy-to-use interface that will help me save time coming up with color palettes for my designs with quick generation.
3. As a colorblind frontend developer, I want to be able to create cohesive color schemes for my web pages, as I am unable to fully view the color schemes myself.
4. As a student studying computer science, I want to be able to easily design my web applications for my classes so that I can focus on the logic of my code.
5. As a recent graduate, I want to create a personal portfolio site with a clean and aesthetic color scheme so that potential employers will be attracted to my page.

## Notes

Needs to make sure that color palettes are accessible, can be generated multiple times, and can easily be saved by the user
