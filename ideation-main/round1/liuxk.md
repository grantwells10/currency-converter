# Chrome Extension Idea: Task Planner

## Authors

Kevin Liu

## Problem Statement

Students and professionals typically have a variety of tasks that need to be completed, but it can be difficult to keep track of them. For example, a student may want to view upcoming homework assignments by deadline, but they may also want to sort them by another classification (e.g., time needed, class) at another time. It would be useful to allow such a student to flexibly manage this collection of tasks.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this extension includes:

* Students (homework and other tasks)
* Professionals (job-related tasks)
* Everyday people (personal tasks)

## Description

This Chrome extension allows users to create, maintain, and organize a to-do list of tasks. Users can customize each task by adding details like deadlines, time needed, etc.

## Selling Points

1. Can view tasks through different kinds of classifications
2. Tracks time spent on each task (if desired)
3. Simple interface that makes it easy to add and manage tasks
4. Can customize tasks by adding tags
5. Alerts users of approaching deadlines

## User Stories

1. As a student with many classes, I want to organize tasks by deadline *or* by class so I can keep track of each class's assignments.
2. As a user that appreciates simplicity, I want to add/delete tasks very easily through just a click of a button.
3. As a user who wants to be efficient, I want to keep track of how much time I am spending on each task.
4. As a user who wants to plan for the future, I want to add how much time I expect to spend on each task.
5. As a user with many complicated tasks, I want to be able to add sub-tasks to each task.

## Notes

There are many new features that can be added to make this a general work management tool, not just a to-do list.
