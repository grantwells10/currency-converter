# Chrome Extension Idea: Shopping Discounts

## Authors

Akanksha Tripathy

## Problem Statement

Multiple retailers sell similar products for drastically different prices, or offer discounts at different times. It is often difficult to determine whether one is gettting the best deals and discounts and it's easy to overpay. 

## Target Audience

Online shoppers, particularly savvy shoppers on a budget (typically young people) who are willing to compare discounts.

## Description

This extension will query keywords describing a particular product on a number of websites that sell similar products. The extension will allow users to compare prices, and list the promotions
that each retailer is offering at a given time. The extension will also allow users to input coupon codes that they have found success with, and will add this to a growing list of codes for the 
respective website, which will be shared wih shoppers. 

## Selling Points

1. The extension cuts down on the time users spend shopping and finding discounts.
2. The extension informs shoppers of new retailers that may offer similar products for less.
3. A community of shoppers can be built using the extension by allowing users to share codes.
4. Shoppers save money and can get more products for less.
5. 

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to improve budgeting techniques so that I can save money.
2. As a software engineer, I want to create effective webscraping strategies to determine the best discounts.
3. As a shopper, I want to seamlessly integrate the extension with current e-com capabilities so that I spend less time shopping.
4. As an administrator, I want privacy and authentication so that user information is not shared.
5. As a student, I want efficiency and efficacy, so that I find discounts quickly when I need them.

## Notes

This extension might need some type of verification strategy to make sure that user codes are valid. There may also need to be a way to distinguish between tiers of users of websites who receive different types of discounts.
