# Chrome Extension Idea: TempEmail

## Authors

Adam Gorka

## Problem Statement

A pretty common problem is encountering websites that are soft-locked by a login page that requires you to make an account. This is problematic as
noone wants their personal email to be spammed, but they still want access to the service. My extension will automatically generate an email account to be used
for the temporary account, and it can be used to confirm the account. 

## Target Audience

The target audience is users that want to create quick temporary accounts for one-time uses.

## Description

When a user is creating an account for an online service, they can generate a temporary email address and password for their account. The extension
will verify the account, enabling the user to have a temporary account instantly. 

## Selling Points

1. It is quick and easy to use
2. Users no longer need to share their personal email information
3. Can autofill and sign in for you
4. Bypass soft-locked websites
5. Automatically confirms email-sign up account creation

## User Stories

As a student, I want to be able to create quick temporary accounts to let me use services online that require me to share my personal email. 
As a privacy-conscious chrome user, I want to create temporary accounts without sharing my personal info with websites.
As a spam-conscious chrome user, I want to create temporary accounts that won't leave my email full of spam.
As a student, I don't have much time and don't want to comfirm email addresses for my accounts.
As a student, I want to sign up for a service by only clicking one button. 

## Notes

Challenges:
 - Figuring out email service, how to provide temp emails

Could instead shift to just being a service to automatically confirm email accounts - attached to gmail.
