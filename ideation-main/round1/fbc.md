## Problem Statement

Instagram follower assistant. Some people care about their follower/follows ratio, so my extension aims to go through each of the user's followers and unfollow if they do not follow the user.

## Target Audience

The target audience for IgCleaner includes:

- Teenagers and adults who use instagram frequently
- Users who want to have a well proportioned Instagram profile
- Users who want their instagram account to look celebrity-like

## Description

Some people care about their follower/follows ratio, so my extension aims to go through each of the user's followers and unfollow if they do not follow the user (unless they are a celebrity or similar). Additionally, it should store the people that it has unfollowed so that the user can do whatever they
want with that information. Additional feature to send massive amounts of follow requests, then unfollow the people who followed the user back to further increase positively the ratio for greater users

## Selling Points

1. Increase the number of followers by an amount that the user chooses
2. Delete the people who do not follow you back
3. Lock specific people who do not follow you so that they are not deleted
4. Celebrities and content creators are not unfollowed
5. Simple user interface. Perform actions with the click of a button 

## User Stories

1. As a high school teenager, I want to remove people who do not follow me back so that I can 
make other people think I am popular
2. As a business owner, I want people to think that I have a lot of customers by increasing my followers amount
3. As a marketer, I want to use the "Increase Follower" feature strategically to expand our brand's reach and visibility on Instagram, ultimately driving more traffic and conversions to our website or products.
4. As a user concerned about privacy, I want assurance that my account will not be unfollowed without my consent or knowledge, ensuring that I maintain control over my follower list and interactions on Instagram.
5. As a user, I want the extension to provide recommendations for accounts to follow based on my interests, engagement history, and the content I interact with on Instagram.
