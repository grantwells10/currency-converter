## Problem Statement
People often want to keep track of their favorite players and their statistics for resaons such as fantasy sports leagues or for their enjoyment of the sport.
Currently, one may have have to use a fantasy sport app, ESPN, or even Google to rely on such updates--there seems to be a lack of a product which allows for 
specfic updates on players, teams, and important events. Such information could help sports fans decide what teams and players to focus their time on when
they want to watch/think about sports. 

## Target Audience

The target audience of my Chrome extension would be sports fans who want more tailored updates about their sports in a seamless fashion.

## Description

My Chrome extension would allow users to set some paramters on which teams and players they want to follow and what sport outcomes they want to be notified about.
This could be anything from an alert that a particular player has scored many points or a reminder that a game will start in 30 minutes. Then, the Chrome extension will provide a notfication to the user with the associated information that the user may care about. 

## Selling Points

1. Customization of the notification features
2. Ability to turn off updates during various times of the day
3. Simple and easily understandable interface for user customization
4. Concise information in the notifcation. 
5. Real time updates.

## User Stories

1. As a casual basketball fan, I want to decide what players I want to watch. I use the Chrome extension to give me updates on the highest-scoring players in the NBA
2. As a diehard Warriors fan, I only want to watch Warriors games if the score is close. I configure the update settings so I only get notified when the score is close
3. As a an owner of multiple fantasy sports teams, I want to get updates on various different sports leagues from a single source. I modify the update settings to receive updates on both the NBA and the NFL
4. As someone who loves the NBA but doesn't want constant updates in class, I will use the Chrome extension to configure updates for my favorite team only in the hours which I am not in class.
5. As someone who doesn't want to read long ESPN articles about various games or players, I will use the Chrome extension to receive concise updates about events that I can quickly read.
## Notes

Need to make customization interface lightweight and accessible. Additionally, need to have quick real-time updates.
