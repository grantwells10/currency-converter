## Problem Statement

Organizing and keeping track of various events can be challenging, especially when information about them is scattered across different web pages. Users often have to manually enter event details into their calendars, a process that can be both time-consuming and error-prone. This Chrome Extension aims to streamline this process, making it easier for users to add events to their calendars directly from web content, thereby enhancing productivity and reducing the chances of missing important events.

## Target Audience

The target audience for Event Scheduler includes:

- Busy professionals who need to manage their schedules efficiently.
- Students who attend multiple events, lectures, and deadlines.
- Anyone who frequently adds events from websites to their personal calendars.
- Organizers who need to keep track of various meetings and events.

## Description

QuickAdd is a Chrome Extension that simplifies the process of adding events to Google Calendar. By simply highlighting text on a webpage that contains the place, date, and time of an event, users can add the event to their calendar with just one click. This extension detects relevant event information from highlighted text and auto-fills the event creation form on Google Calendar, making event scheduling seamless and efficient.

## Selling Points

1. Automatically detects and extracts event details (place, date, and time) from highlighted text.
2. One-click addition of events to Google Calendar directly from any web page.
3. Saves time and reduces the risk of manual entry errors.
4. Streamlines the process of managing personal and professional schedules.
5. Customizable settings to choose default reminders and privacy options for added events.

## User Stories

1. As a busy professional, I want to quickly add events to my calendar without manually entering details, so that I can manage my schedule more efficiently.
2. As a student, I want to easily transfer lecture and exam dates from my university's website to my calendar, so that I can keep track of my academic schedule.
3. As a frequent event attendee, I want to add events to my calendar directly from event pages, so that I don't miss out on important dates and times.
4. As an organizer, I want to streamline the process of scheduling multiple meetings and events, so that I can avoid conflicts and ensure smooth operations.
5. As a user, I want to customize how events are added to my calendar, including default reminders, so that I can personalize my scheduling experience.

## Notes

While the extension is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, it will require permissions to access the user's Google Calendar to add events. Future versions could include features like language detection for non-English websites, integration with other calendar services, and the ability to suggest event categories based on the content of the highlighted text.
