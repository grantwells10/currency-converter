## Problem Statement

Students get flooded with hundreds of emails every week regardings open roles/internships within startups, companies/enterprises, school clubs, university programs, etc. These communications can be cumbersome/overwhelming to organize. Moreover, due to the continuous influx of emails students receive daily, it's common to miss deadlines that weren't communicated very recently.  

## Target Audience

The target audience for OnTheDot is anyone who wants to get their potential opportunities in line. The audience can range from...
1. Students (juniors/seniors) looking to organize recruiting efforts (summer/semester internships, co-ops, research).
2. Students (freshmen/sophomores) looking to get involved with more on-campus activities (school clubs, startups, university programs, etc.)
3. Students/faculty (masters, postdocs) looking for research grants

## Description

This Chrome Extension will help users keep track of the open opportunities they wish to follow up on after having caught wind (via email communication, indepedent research, etc.) of it. Opportunities can be sorted into "buckets", predefined by the user, that will categorize the **type** of opportunity (i.e. industry internship, club, startup, etc.). Upon reaching the application page for an opportunity of interest, you can open OnTheDot and (OPTIONALLY) indicate your level of preference to opt for this opportunity. OnTheDot will automatically add this link, deadline/rolling admissions (via website crawling) to the according bucket in its managed database. OnTheDot will also maintain a suggested timeline for completing the applications, taking into account your level of preference and deadline. Everytime a new opportunity is added, OnTheDot will update this timeline. 

## Selling Points
