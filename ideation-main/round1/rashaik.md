# Chrome Extension Idea: [Title]

## Authors

## Problem Statement

For those in large organizations (schools, companies, etc) it can be overwhelming trying to figure out who you know that may be a part of an email chain (whether as a sender, participant, or recipient). It may be confusing or perhaps one might not remember who a specific person is within an organization.

## Target Audience

College students and those working/a part of large organizations (companies)

## Description

This extension will allow users to login to and connect their LinkedIn accounts. Then, on any emails (say on Gmail), those who are "known connections" on LinkedIn, will have their names underlined. Additionally, a name is a LinkedIn connection, the user can also see additional information (such as their LinkedIn Bio)

## Selling Points

1. Quickly see who you might be related to / already acquainted with.
2. View further information on those who are connected to you
3. Connect YOUR LinkedIn account for centralized and consistent tracking of connections
4. Possibly to expand this past just emails - into general articles and websites too.
5. [Selling Point 5]

## User Stories

1. As a _student_, I want to _easily view information on another student (Degree, Job, Interests)_ if I have been aquainted with them before (Connected on LinkedIn) to _better understand how I can communicate with them and what their skillsets might be_.

_[List user stories that describe the main features of your Chrome Extension. Use the following template: "As a [user role], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]." Fill in the brackets with the appropriate information. For Round 1, write 5 user stories; Round 2, write 10 user stories; Round 3, write 15 user stories.]_

## Notes

Rather than using a pop-up or sidebar (which could work), I believe an extension like this would be more useful if it directly injected code into the webpage of whatever you are viewing (such as by creating custom underlines)
