### Problem Statement
In the digital age, it's easy to lose track of time while browsing the internet or scrolling through social media, leading to decreased productivity and potential overuse of certain websites. This can affect personal well-being, work performance, and even interpersonal relationships. Users need a tool that helps manage their online time more effectively, encouraging healthier digital habits.

### Target Audience
The target audience for the Mindful Browsing Timer includes:

- Professionals working from home seeking to boost productivity.
- Students who want to limit distractions while studying.
- Individuals trying to cultivate better digital habits and reduce screen time.
- Anyone interested in balancing their online and offline life.

### Description
The Mindful Browsing Timer is a Chrome Extension that helps users manage the amount of time spent on specific websites. It allows them to set custom timers for any website, after which they are gently reminded to take a break or move on to different tasks. This tool is designed to increase awareness of browsing habits and promote a more mindful approach to internet use.

### Selling Points
- Customizable timers for different websites to help users stay on task.
- Notifications that gently remind users to take breaks or end their browsing session.
- Detailed statistics on browsing habits, offering insights into how time online is spent.
- A focus mode that temporarily blocks access to designated sites to minimize distractions.
- Simple, intuitive interface for setting up and managing timers with minimal effort.

### User Stories
- As a freelance writer, I want to limit my time on social media during work hours so that I can focus on my writing projects without distractions.
- As a college student, I need to allocate specific amounts of study time to different subjects without falling down the rabbit hole of unrelated internet browsing.
- As someone who's trying to cultivate a healthier work-life balance, I want to monitor and reduce my overall screen time in the evenings to spend more quality time with my family.
- As a project manager working remotely, I need to ensure I'm using my online time efficiently across various platforms without overextending on any.

### Notes
The Mindful Browsing Timer should be user-friendly, allowing for quick setup of timers and adjustments as needed. Privacy is a key concern; therefore, the extension should not collect or share personal browsing data. Additionally, integrating motivational quotes or tips on digital wellness into the break reminders could further enhance the user's experience by encouraging positive online habits and mindfulness.
