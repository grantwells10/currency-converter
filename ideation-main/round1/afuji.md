# Chrome Extension Idea: Clockwork

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Currently, there are a lot of different apps that target multiple "problems" that root to the same source: time-management.  There are many techniques to help manage and track one's time, but a lot of digital solutions are scattered across different platforms, devices, and appplications.  This app will strive to address issues with short-term planning, shallow and deep focus sessions, time-blocking, and record-keeping.

## Target Audience

Students, people with ADHD, and especially students with ADHD.

Students experience a lot of new independence and new responsibilities such as needing to keep track of one's own schedule and homework progress.

People with ADHD face challenges with executive dysfunction and time-blindness, which increases the complexity of any time-management system or plan.  Some people with ADHD have poor working memories, which means they experience an increased cognitive load trying to hold many ideas, tasks, strategies, actions, and thoughts in their head while working.  Sometimes even something as simple as a to-do list (or even the breakdown of a single task into smaller, actionable tasks) can weigh pretty heavily on an ADHD-er's mind, when they could be using that brainpower to complete their objectives instead.

People with ADHD are often best motivated through external means (i.e. accountability) and through a gamification system, adding novelty to their activities that stimulate the brain.  People with ADHD also work in different ways, and may have trouble identifying actionable strategies that could assist their time-management abilities.  

Students with ADHD experience the combination of the two characteristics of both demographics they are a part of.

## Description

A customizable app that allows you to add in components based on your current needs:
Pomodoro, stopwatch, normal timer, todo list with the ability to break down tasks into subtasks, schedule for time-blocking, notes app for non-time related things, a "later" section for things that will come up but are not going to be worked on within the session

Keeps track of your actions within this app and within chrome and generates a time-log

perhaps nofication feature to remind people to come back? but customizable so people are not annoyed

## Selling Points

1. Being a chrome extension, you don't need to have an extra window open perpetually (mitigating the 1000 chrome tabs issue)
2. It offers a variety of tools instead of just one, and allows the user to customize their own experience
3. It combines planning with time-keeping, so one doesn't have to worry about both (i.e. what they want to happen versus what really happens)
4. simple interface that isn't distracting
5. "later" section allows for rollover into the next day/session you work

## User Stories

As a person with ADHD, I want to combine todo-lists with time-blocking so that I can track my progress throughout the day as I execute my plan.

As a person with time-blindness, I want to be reminded when I haven't started my pomodoro timer, in case I forgot to restart it again.

As a student, I want to connect the time-block schedule with my own calendar, so that I can see when I can add time blocks for studying or work, and when I have other commitments

As a person with poor memory, I want to keep track of how well I stay on my plan/schedule over time, so that I can see looking back on the day/week if I stuck to my schedule or not.

As a student with ADHD, I want to be able to write down future tasks so I don't have to worry about forgetting them, but not put them on today's todo list because it would overwhelm me.
