## Problem Statement

While watching videos on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, or Bilibili, it's common to encounter captivating background music without any way to identify the song. Traditionally, the best one could do is try to remember some lyrics (which can be challenging) and search for them on Google, a method that's both time-consuming and often fruitless. The "BGM Recognizer" extension solves this problem by instantly recognizing any background music playing through your device with just a single click. Additionally, it offers the convenience of syncing with music apps such as Spotify, Apple Music, or NetEase Music, allowing you to easily add any identified songs directly to your playlists.
