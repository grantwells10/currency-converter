# Chrome Extension Idea: Time Spent on Chrome

## Authors

Alec Dempsey

## Problem Statement

Time spent on the internet can dissapear, as minutes become hours and so on. Unlike IOS and other operating systems, Google Chrome does not have an in-built tool for keeping track of ones hours online accross different websites. This can lead to bad habits and a lot of wasted time!

## Target Audience

The target audience is anyone who has difficulty managing their time online and often distracted, as well as anyone who enjoys stats and creating cool visualizations of how they spent their time.

## Description

Time Spent on Chrome would keep track of time spent on each site, both as the main window and the side tab, categorizing what type of site, and if you wish, set up blocking features once an alloted amount of time passes.

## Selling Points

1. Keeps track of time spent on different sites
2. Categorizes how time is spent on chrome
3. Creates interesting visualizations of data
4. Able to export data as CSVs or other common data formats
5. Keeps data private so that only you can see how your time is spent

## User Stories

1. As a user with bad time management, I want to keep track of how I spent my time on Chrome, so that I can improve my habits

## Notes

One key decision is how to decide what is an "active" window to accurately keep track of time spent, as many people including myself will have many tabs accross different windows open.
