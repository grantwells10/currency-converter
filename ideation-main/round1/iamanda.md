## Problem Statement

Trip planning can take a lot of work to do, especially when you are on a budget and need to consider how much each activity costs. This is even more difficult when planning for international trips, and you don't know how much it costs to book hotels and activities. With the exchange of currency and their fluctuating values, it can be hard to keep track of how much you are spending.

## Target Audience

The target audience for BudgeTrip includes:

- Users with planning trips on a budget
- Users keeping track of costs for international trips
- Users that want to compare costs of activities, places to stay, etc when planning
- Users that often travel between different countries and want to stay on top of their spending habits
