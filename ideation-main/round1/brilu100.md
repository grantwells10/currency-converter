# Chrome Extension Idea: StocksRead

## Authors

Brian Lu

## Problem Statement

There is too much information everywhere in the market. We do not have the time to review the new information and if the news is good or bad for a certains stock.

## Target Audience

- Beginner traders
- Traders who do not have time to read current events/articles on stocks
- Traders who just want a simple opinion on if a stock is doing good or bad today

## Description

StocksRead will provide a rating based off current events/articles it has read for a certain time frame. It will give insight on how positive or negative events are in a certain timeframe. It will have the top negative and positive reports for each ticker.

## Selling Points

1. Will read the information so you don't have to
2. Gives a rating to show degree of good/bad news currently is
3. Saves the time instead of searching for articles
4. Simple UI, just type in stock ticker symbol
5. Color green or red for easy view

## User Stories

1. As a worker, I want to access the sentiment of certain stocks easy and fast, so that I do not have to waste time I do not have
2. As a finance journalist, I want to check that the other articles have similar opinions, so that I do not get sued for misinformation.
3. As an advanced trader, I want to have extra confirmation, so that I am on the right side of the market
4. As a shareholder, I want to confirm that the stock I am holding is doing somewhat alright, so that I do not have to panic when the price begins going down
5. As an algorithmic trader, I want to incorporate other aspects/features to my own trading bot, so that it will be more accurate.


## Notes

Challenges: Getting articles behind paywall. Getting articles that have false information. Finding connection between news like interest rates and stocks.
Needs to return a rating, need some model to determine the rating value, and need some way to access information
