## Authors

## Problem Statement

With the vast amount of information available online, it's easy for readers to get distracted by ads, pop-ups, and unrelated content when trying to focus on reading articles online. This can lead to a decrease in comprehension and retention of the material, making the learning process less efficient and more time-consuming (and frustration among the readers themsevles, like me).

## Target Audience

The target audience is extensive and includes students, researchers, casual readers, and professionals who rely on online resources for learning, work, or leisure reading.

## Description

This Chrome Extension enhances the online reading experience by providing a distraction-free environment. It will automatically detect and hide non-essential elements like ads, sidebars, pop-ups, and other distractions, leaving only the main content visible. Users can customize what elements to hide or show according to their preferences.

## Selling Points

1. Enhanced focus and concentration by removing distractions.
2. Customizable settings to suit individual reading preferences.
3. Ability to save preferred settings for specific websites.
4. Increases reading speed and comprehension by minimizing eye movement and cognitive load.
5. Easy toggle on/off for when users want to switch between focused reading and normal browsing.

## User Stories

1. As a student conducting research for a paper, I want to focus on reading scholarly articles without being distracted by ads or unrelated content.
2. As a casual reader, I want to read blog posts in a clean and simplified format that makes the reading experience more enjoyable.
3. As a professional, I need to quickly go through online reports and documents without distractions to save time and increase efficiency.
4. As a user with attention difficulties, I want a reading mode that helps me concentrate on the text without getting overwhelmed by too much on-screen clutter.
5. As an e-book enthusiast, I want a consistent reading interface across different online platforms to simulate a more traditional book-reading experience.

## Notes

One of the challenges will be implementing a robust content detection algorithm that can accurately identify and isolate the main content from the rest of the webpage without removing useful elements or breaking the site's functionality. 
## References & Inspiration

Inspired by the common problem of online distraction and the need for a more focused and efficient reading experience on the internet. Similar functionality can be seen in various "reader mode" features integrated into some browsers, but this extension aims to offer more customization and control to the user.
