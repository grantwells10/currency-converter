# Chrome Extension Idea: BroadcastViewer

## Authors

Clara Fee

## Problem Statement

Many college radio stations without official FM broadcasting use online broadcasting systems. When a user tries to tune in using these systems, the display is often ugly and non-user friendly (just a blank screen with a link on it, for example).

## Target Audience

College radio stations without FM broadcasting and indpendant radio broadcasting stations without FM broadcasting

## Description

The extension will allow the user to input the streaming link, and then generates short looping video display (fireplace burning, aquarium, etc) that plays the audio from the streaming link. 

## Selling Points

1. Simple to use; just copy and paste the streaming link into box and it will open a new tab with the video display.
2. Creates a better looking visual interface for radio/audio streaming.
3. Can be used for any streaming link that plays audio continually.
4. Can increase listenership and radio loyalty as users will be more likely to listen with better UX/visual display.
5. Allows user to select or change the visual display option.

## User Stories
