# Chrome Extension Idea: SHOW ME ADS PLEASE

## Authors

Sam May

## Problem Statement

I am easily distractable and would like to increase the barrier for me getting off track.

## Target Audience

Students, knowledge workers, WFH-mers, me.

## Description

This chrome extension injects unskippable ads when visiting certain websites on a block-list. For people that hate ads, this increases the "barrier to be distracted". Kind of like angry Tab for a Cause.

## Selling Points

1. Productively redirects annoyance at seeing ads
2. Helps to break bad "reflex opening" habits
3. Creates more awareness about how time online is being spent
4. Increases intention when visiting sites
5. Distracting sites are ultimately still available without removing them from the block-list

## User Stories

1. As a person who works from home, I want to decrease the ease with which I can visit distracting sites to make myself more accountable

2. As a chronic doom-scroller, I would like auto-interrupt ads on a semi-random timer to break me out of habitual social media use

3. As a knowledge-worker, I would like time-tracking for sites that I have as my active tab so that I can more effectively assess how I am spending my time online

4. As a chronic online shopper, I would like the option to have an ad-free timer so that I do not view ads that might distract me even further

5. As a casual browser, I would like functionality to block only certain pages on sites so that I can still use productive parts of a site and avoid distracting parts

## Notes

This strategy may be very easy to circumvent if the block-list is easily modifiable. There may need to be protections against editing which sites are blocked. Also probably not very effective for shopaholic
