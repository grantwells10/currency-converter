## Authors

## Problem Statement

Many students and people searching for jobs are having extreme difficulties staying on top of application deadlines and what jobs are even open.
Currently, job hunters have to manually enter deadlines into calendars and have to look up themselves when a given company opens their applications.

## Target Audience
JobTracks target audience is as follows:
- students who are juggling schoolwork and job applications
- job hunters applying to a lot of jobs
- job hunters who have an idea of what job / companies they want to work for
- job hunters who spend a lot of time applying to jobs
- job hunters who utilize simplify.jobs
- job hunters who like to stay organized and keep a calendar

## Description

JobTracks is a chrome extension that notifies users when they an upcoming job application related deadline (whether it be an application, phone-call, job-posting)

## Selling Points

1. Keeps a neat calendar that is exportable
2. Sends notifications where you choose (email, desktop, mobile push?)
3. Easy to use with a simple UI
4. Company selector allows users to choose companies they already know they would like to work at
5. Simplify.jobs compatability

## User Stories
1. As a job hunter, I want to input companies I'm interested in so that I can get notifications about jobs they post
2. As a job hunter, I want to input dates and times for when job related applications are due so I can be notified in appropriate intervals when to work on them / submit
3. As a job hunter, I want compatability with simplify.jobs so that whenever I submit an application the company is added to JobTracks and get notifications about updates
4. As a minimalist, I want a clean UI so that I know where to go to do what I need to do 
5. As a job hunter, I want to wipe a job/company off my tracker so that I stay focused on what's ahead not behind

## Notes
Simplify.jobs is a very useful Chrome extension that autofills job applications. In tandem, I think a chrome extension such as mine could work well together.
