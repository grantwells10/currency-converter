## Target Audience

Individuals with little time who still want to learn a new langauge

## Description

The Chrome extension will indentify random words on any web page you visit and auto-translate them into the target language, thus increasing familiarity. Clicking on the word will reveal its translation in the original language. Some easier words will be selected first for translation, and as the user progresses (that is, does not click on the word to reveal its translation and thus displaying familiarity), harder words will be translated to the target language.

## Selling Points

1. Streamlined in the webpage
2. Easy translation if foreign word is unknown (just click)
3. Difficulty of words increases with mastery
4. Flashcard-like test integrated in already standard activity (web browsing)
5. Dictionary definition and context of the word available with a click

## User Stories

As a very busy person with little free time, I want still would like to learn a language in a way that is integrated with my existing workflow so that I don't have to set aside seperate time for study

As the spouse of a partner who speaks a foreign language natively, I would like to pick up on a few basic words and phrases to converse with them, without excessive study.

As a person who learns best by the active recall method, I would like to integrate a flashcard-like langauge learning method into an activity I already frequently do in order to learn a new langauge.

As a person frequently confused about when to use certain words and phrases in certain contexts in my second language, I want to be able to be confident when I read and speak in that tongue.

As a person who learned a foreign language in the past but has now forgotten much of it, I want to be able to brush up on my skills by re-familiarizing myself with the vocabulary.

## Notes

The font of the word should match the font of the webpage. The word translation should adapt to the context of the sentence (that is, *fly* ought to be translated as either *mosca* or *volar* if target language is spanish, depending on context).
