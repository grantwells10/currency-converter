## Problem Statement
Numerous users deal with a variety of PDF files for work, school, or personal projects, and often need to combine these into a single document. This can be for organizational purposes, to compile reports, or to create portfolios. Currently, combining PDFs into one document can require external software or online services, which might not always be readily accessible, secure, or user-friendly. Users are seeking a more integrated, reliable solution that saves time and enhances productivity directly within their browser.

## Target Audience
The target audience includes:
- Professionals who need to compile reports or documentation.
- Students who are combining research papers, study materials, or assignments.
- Individuals working on collaborative projects requiring consolidation of contributions into a single PDF.
- Anyone needing to organize multiple PDF files into a single document for ease of sharing or presentation.

QuickMerge is a Chrome Extension that allows users to concatenate two PDFs together quickly. With a few clicks, users can quickly merge their PDF documents for whatever purpose they may need to fulfill.
