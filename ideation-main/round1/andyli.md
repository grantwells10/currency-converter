## Authors

## Problem Statement

A reliable, trustworthy, all-in-one place to do basic editing with pdfs besides Adobe, which has limitations if done for free, is hard to come by. [Or at least as far as I know]

## Target Audience

An everyday person who wants to make simple modifications to their pdfs without paying for an Adobe subscription.

## Description

## Selling Points

1. Merge and resize pdfs
2. Rotate and flip pdfs
3. Works offline
4. Work on pdfs but also pngs, jpegs, etc.
5. Doesnâ€™t save anything about a pdf after working with it

## User Stories

3. As a user, I want to be able to modify my pdfs even if the internet goes out.
