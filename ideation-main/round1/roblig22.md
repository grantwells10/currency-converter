# Chrome Extension Idea: KeyWard

## Problem Statement

It is very difficult to look up songs without having verbal information about it such as the title and lyrics. This is most problematic for genres like jazz and classical, where purely instrumental music is common and, especially for the latter, titles are almost never memorable. And although there are ways to search up such songs by humming their melody, it is difficult and frankly embarrassing to convincingly hum complex melodies to your computer.

## Target Audience

Anyone who has had a song stuck in their head could benefit from this extension, although I'd imagine it will be easier to use + more useful to those with musical experience

## Description

This is a virtual piano which allows the user to play a melody from their computer’s keyboard, and look up songs which contain the melody they have just played. It is intended to provide a convenient way to find songs for which the user only remembers the melody

## Selling Points

1. Barrier to Entry: due to not requiring any vocal expertise on the user’s part, searching will be much easier than humming-based search methods
2. Discreteness: unlike humming search, this can be used in public without causing a disruption
3. Entertainment: as evidenced by the YouTube trumpet video with millions of views, simulating instruments using mouse + keyboard is simply fun
4. Educational: becoming familiar with this application's interface can be a good way to picking up musical basics
5. Generalizable searches: thanks to the piano's universality across virtually on music genres, using it to make search queries allows coverage of any song imaginable

## User Stories

As a classical music fan, I can search for melodies whose source I do not remember so that I can enjoy the work in its entirety.

As someone who cannot sing, I can find so that I do not have to rely on my inconsistent humming.

As someone currently in a public space, I can find the song I've been thinking of discretely so that I do not bother those around me.

## Notes

1. Heavy visual handholding may be necessary, as the piano interface might not be immediately intuitive to those without musical experience
2. For sanity of results, it may be a good idea to filter to the most popular / well-known options for a particular query
