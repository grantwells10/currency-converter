## Authors

Ahmed Abdellah 

## Problem Statement

Currently, there are no ways to automatically handle crypto trade PnLs accross several chains and wallets. 

## Target Audience

Traders looking to easily manage positions. 

## Description

A chrome extension that automatically detects major wallet providers, and can recognize trades made within that wallet.The app will 
automaticlaly detect when assets are bought and sold and can create earnings reports or automatic stop-losses. 


## Selling Points

1. Being a chrome extension, you don't need to have an extra window open perpetually (mitigating the 1000 chrome tabs issue)
2. It offers a variety of tools instead of just one, and allows the user to customize their own experience
3. It combines automatic PnL with 
4. simple interface that is easy to use and allows for automatic liquidations 
5. "report" shows your historical portfolio performance

## User Stories

As a trader with limited time, sometimes I'm unable to track all of my trades. 

As a portfolio manager using multiple chains and proviers, it's difficult to create reports for executives on aggergated performance. 

As a trader with a sleep schedule, I want to set up certain stop-losses on risky trades since the market never sleeps.
