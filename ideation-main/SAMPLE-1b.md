## Authors

## Problem Statement

When browsing the web, users often come across valuable information or snippets of text that they want to save for future reference or learning. However, simply collecting these snippets doesn't actively help users memorize or engage with the content. Additionally, creating flashcards manually based on these snippets can be time-consuming and tedious.

- Students who want to create study materials from online resources
- Lifelong learners who enjoy collecting and memorizing interesting facts or quotes
- Professionals who need to quickly save and learn important information from the web
- Language learners who want to build their vocabulary and comprehension skills

## Description

Users can save snippets with a single click, and the extension intelligently creates questions based on the content, transforming passive reading into active learning.
